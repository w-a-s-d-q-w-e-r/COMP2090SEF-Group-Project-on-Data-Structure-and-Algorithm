## Selected Data Structure: Trie (Prefix Tree)

### Abstract Data Type (ADT)
A Trie is a tree-based data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings efficiently. Each node represents a single character, and paths from root to a marked node represent valid words.

**Main operations**:
- insert(word) -> add word to wordlist
- search(word) → check exact match  
- starts_with(prefix) → check if any word begins with given prefix
- delete(word) -> remove the word from the wordlist
- words_with_prefix(prefix) -> find the words starting with a specific prefix
- word_library() -> check the wordlist
- autocomplete(prefix) -> give suggestions on word starting with a specific prefix, ordered base on the searching frequency
- spell_check(word) -> give suggestions on word that searched word is not appear but similar to the words in wordlist, ordered base on the searching frequency

**Key properties**:
- Abstraction: Users interact only with high-level string operations; internal node structure and traversal are hidden.
- Encapsulation: Node children are usually private (dictionary or array).
- Modularity: Trie can be reused for different string-related tasks without changing core logic.

### Real-life applications
- Autocomplete in search engines and mobile keyboards
- Spell checking and correction systems
- Predictive text input in IDEs and messaging apps
- Longest prefix matching in IP routing tables
- Dictionary / word suggestion in text editors

### Time Complexity
- Insert, search, prefix search: O(m) where m is the length of the word  
  (very fast in practice due to constant-time child lookup per character)

## Selected Algorithm: Tim Sort

Tim Sort is a hybrid stable sorting algorithm that combines **insertion sort** (on small runs) with **merge sort** (on larger runs). It is the default sorting algorithm in Python (`list.sort()` and `sorted()`), Java, Android, and many other standard libraries.

### Basic Operation :
Use `tim_sort(array)` to sort a single array

### High-level steps
1. **Identify natural runs** — scan the array to find already sorted segments ("runs") of length at least `min_run` (typically calculated dynamically, often around 32–64).
2. **Reduce comparison** - Use the sorted segments to reduce binary search for sorting remaining items
3. **Use binary insertion sort for small or nearly sorted run** — binary insertion sort is more efficient than insertion sort (*O(n log n) vs O(n^2)*)  on small or nearly sorted data.
4. **Merge runs using merge sort** — progressively merge adjacent runs using a modified merge that exploits existing order (galloping mode in real implementations).
5. **Adaptive merging** — use galloping to skip unnecessary comparisons when one run is much larger.

### Time & Space Complexity
- Best case: O(n) — when array is already sorted or has long runs  
- Average case: O(n log n)  
- Worst case: O(n log n)  
- Space: O(n) — needs temporary array for merging

### Real-life applications
- Default sorting in Python, Java, Swift, Android JDK, Chrome V8 engine
- Sorting large datasets with natural runs (logs, timestamps, partially pre-sorted data)
- Stable sorting where order of equal elements matters (e.g., database records)
